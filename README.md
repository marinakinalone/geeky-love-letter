## What I have learned from this project
I decided to refactor a few of my projects from when I started to learn to code. Geeky Love Letter was my second ever project while learning React JS. It is a continuation of what I have started to practice when I refactored [the Sailor Moon Quote Machine](https://sailor-moon-quote-machine.vercel.app/) : to get more comfortable with Next JS and CSS modules.
